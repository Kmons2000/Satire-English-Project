              Genocide and other cides among that are the worlds reset button.  It is the world's way of fixing problems.  If you don't like a certain group of people, start a genocide.  If you think you are the problem with the world commit suicide.  If you are religious and don't want to be, give deicide a try.  If you think a family memeber has brought great dishonor to your family, commit honour kiling.

              People like Hitler who had the idea to step up and make a change are strong leaders and know how to fix the world.  The Holocaust is a perfect example of how good this is.  Hitler saw a problem and decided to do somehting about it.  If people would've supported what he was doing, he could've finished his mission of making the world a perfect place.
