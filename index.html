              Genocide and other cides are the worlds reset button.  It is the world's way of fixing problems.  If you don't like a certain group of people, start a genocide.  If you think you are the problem with the world, commit suicide.  If you are religious and don't want to be, give deicide a try.  If you can't afford your new baby, infanticide may be right for you.  If you think someone is trying to be a prophet, you need to try vaticide as soon as possible, don't trust those guys.  If you just hate those whales launching themselves out of the water, just commit ceticide.  These are only a few ways to get what you want, the easiest and most legal way.

              Some of the great genocides out there are the Holocaust, Armenia, Cambodia, Rwanda, and Bosnia to name a few.  The Holocaust pit Hitler versus the Jews, and guess what? America won that fight.  Armenia was the Ottoman Empire against Ethnic Americans.  Rowanda set the Tutsi against the Hutu.  This is only a few of the genocides from history.

              People like Hitler who had the idea to step up and make a change are strong leaders and know how to fix the world.  The Holocaust is a perfect example of how good this is.  Hitler saw a problem and decided to do somehting about it.  If people would've supported what he was doing, he could've finished his mission of making the world a perfect place.

              People need to notice that genocide is a very horrific way to try and fix problems.  In general, killing is going to be overkill, so to speak.  So people should go to the government before they go and start on a mass gencide.  I mean if the government says it's fine, then it must be ethical and correct to do, right?
